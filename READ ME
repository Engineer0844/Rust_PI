To build for raspibery make sure you all the toolchain stuff.

ADD RPall library.. add rpall to dependencies in toml
https://github.com/golemparts/rppal

ADD ssh to new pi (will need PI IP address, user name.... )
put priviate key on new pis .ssh folder here

now you can add ur public key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys files so you don't have to type password each time

This is how you build for your target: 
cargo build --target armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf 


To send binary to the target:
scp <filepath> pi:<file destination>
scp target/armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf/debug/pi_rust_p1 pi2:~
